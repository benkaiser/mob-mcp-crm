Second milestone: add relationships between contacts, notes, tags, and groups. This builds out the social graph and organizational features.

## Goals
- Bidirectional relationships with auto-inverse
- All relationship types (Love, Family, Friend, Work, Custom)
- Notes (CRUD, pinning, markdown)
- Tags (CRUD, contact tagging/untagging)
- Groups (CRUD, membership management)
- Tests for all of the above
